# Hi there, I'm Hossein! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year Master of Science student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Tehran. My research interests are centered around artificial intelligence, with a specific focus on spoken language processing and NLP. Python, Java, Kotlin, and R are my go-to coding languages, and I am also familiar with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on meaningful AI projects.

Here on GitHub, I'm excited to engage with fellow enthusiasts, expand my knowledge, and contribute to innovative AI endeavors. 

... and the end ... no ... wait, I'm also a retired professional Android developer :)
